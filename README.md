# Minesweeper
A console-based Minesweeper game written in C:
This project is a part of my initial exploration into the C programming language and showcases my understanding of basic programming concepts.
The Minesweeper game is implemented in a single file, reflecting my early knowledge at the onset of my first year in the degree program. 
The game features a classic Minesweeper grid where players can reveal cells and avoid hidden mines. 
Despite its simplicity, this project marks a crucial milestone in my learning journey. 
Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback is greatly appreciated as I continue to develop my programming skills.
